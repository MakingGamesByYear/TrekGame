Todos and Ideas for possible extension:

Made the file as an md

- Introduce game levels, Novice, Ensign, Corporal, Lieutenant, Captain level
(player is still Captain Kirk, game difficulty changes)
(galaxy size, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, sectors will be 10x10)
(star density per quandrant)
(enemy density)
(mission time)
(random species, random loyalties)
- Introduce Ajax, PHP to save a leaderboard and sign in to save games
- Extend to tournament play mode, Same game difficulty, different players
- Introduce Romulans, Vegans, Andorians, Xindi

Christopher Pugh suggestions

- flavor text / communications from enemy ships
- phaser target list could be dynamic based on evolving gameplay alliances, etc :) 
- redo mirror universe code so it's not a hard coded reskin
- phaser accuracy with distance?
- cloaking device
- generalized adjacency test as part of the game update / object api.  could have like star radiation, enemy ramming, etc.
- additional game events like onEnterSector, onLeaveSector, onShipDestroyed, etc.
- find a probe that uncovers part of the map.
- different enemy types
- bosses
- factions
- mission objectives beyond kill everything
- landing on planets
- fork and do entirely touch / mouse based UI from scratch
- remove captain's manual.  Make UI fully self documenting or add intro mission.
    - can start game docked at starbase.
- hand authored map chunks
- planets that have nothing, have different things / different functionality
- warp inaccuracy when engines damaged?
- scan enemy could fail / be resisted?
- Fix long range jump cheat (long range jump into same quadrant as a free way to teleport)
- enemy ships have a random chance of hypercharging shields or phasers.  or cloaking.  or teleport.
- make everything in character, make a warp factor calculator, etc.
- literally any AI behaviors
