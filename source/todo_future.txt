Todos and Ideas for possible extension:

- flavor text / communications from enemy ships
- phaser target list could be dynamic based on evolving gameplay alliances, etc :) 
- redo mirror universe code so it's not a hard coded reskin
- phaser accuracy with distance?
- cloaking device
- generalized adjacency test as part of the game update / object api.  could have like star radiation, enemy ramming, etc.
- additional game events like onEnterSector, onLeaveSector, onShipDestroyed, etc.
- find a probe that uncovers part of the map.
- different enemy types
- bosses
- factions
- mission objectives beyond kill everything
- landing on planets
- fork and do entirely touch / mouse based UI from scratch
- remove captain's manual.  Make UI fully self documenting or add intro mission.
    - can start game docked at starbase.
- hand authored map chunks
- planets that have nothing, have different things / different functionality
- warp inaccuracy when engines damaged?
- scan enemy could fail / be resisted?
- Fix long range jump cheat (long range jump into same quadrant as a free way to teleport)
- enemy ships have a random chance of hypercharging shields or phasers.  or cloaking.  or teleport.
- make everything in character, make a warp factor calculator, etc.
- literally any AI behaviors
